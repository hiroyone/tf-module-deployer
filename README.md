# tf-module-deployer

This repository contains a Go CLI tool (`tf-module-deployer`) designed to facilitate the deployment of Terraform modules by organizing files into a `.tf-module` directory.

## Setup for Developers

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Go (version 1.16 or higher recommended)
- Git

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tf-module-deployer.git
cd tf-module-deployer
```

### Build the Project

To build the `tf-module-deployer` CLI tool, run the following command from the root directory of the repository:

```bash
go build -o bin/tf-module-deployer ./cmd/tf-module-deployer
```

This command compiles the Go package located at `cmd/tf-module-deployer`, which includes `main.go`, `deploy.go`, and any other necessary files.

## Usage

Once built, you can use the `tf-module-deployer` CLI to deploy Terraform modules. Here are some example commands:

```bash
# Deploy the Terraform module
./tf-module-deployer deploy
```

Replace `./tf-module-deployer` with the appropriate path or command if you've installed it globally or set an alias.
